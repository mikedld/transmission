# Transmission Web Client

A web interface is built into all Transmission flavors, enabling them to be controlled remotely.

## Developing locally

First, in this web directory, run `npm i` to install all dependencies. (Youâ€™ll need to have node and npm installed, of course.)

Run `npm run dev` to compile the source javascript files into a bundle, then navigate to [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000/).

Webpack will automatically compile on save, so you should see any changes reflected immediately.
