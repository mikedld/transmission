# Transmission Web Client

A web interface is built into all Transmission flavors, enabling them to be controlled remotely.

## Building Without Node

Transmission includes a prebuilt webapp bundle in its releases because
the bundling tools are not easy to install on all of the target platforms
that Transmission supports.

Debian has understandable security concerns about shipping prebuilt
bundles and would prefer to generate the bundle itself without requiring
a network connection (e.g. for `npm install`). Unfortunately, this is
problematic due to some `devDependencies` that aren't available as Debian
packages.

Follow these steps to build webapp on Debian without Node.js:

```sh
$ sudo apt install rsass perl esbuild
$ cd transmission/web/
$ rsass assets/css/transmission-app.scss > assets/css/transmission-app.css
$ perl -p -i -e 's/transmission-app.scss/transmission-app.css/' src/main.js
$ esbuild \
  --allow-overwrite \
  --bundle \
  --legal-comments=external \
  --loader:.png=binary \
  --loader:.svg=binary \
  --minify \
  --outfile=public_html/transmission-app.js \
  src/main.js
```

## Notes for Developers

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000/) to run the app.

When you use `npm run dev`, the bundler will stay running in the
background and will rebuild transmission-app.js whenever you change
and save a source file. When it's done, you can reload the page in
your browser to see your changes in action.

## Notes for Testers

Use this bookmarklet to anonymize your torrent names before submitting a screenshot:

`javascript:void%20function(){const%20a=document.getElementsByClassName(%22torrent-name%22);for(const%20b%20of%20a)console.log(b),b.textContent=%22Lorem%20ipsum%20dolor%20sit%20amet.iso%22}();`

Youâ€™ll typically have about 3 seconds before the next batch of RPC updates overwrite the text content of any currently-downloading files.
