Motuopuhi is designed and developed by Gary Elshaw <godard@hotmail.com>.

A simple MacOS monochrome styled theme for QT or GTK with Transmission.

In Māori culture or Te Ao Māori (The Māori World), a part of our identity is based on the land and water that surround us. Motuopuhi [Mo-to-o-poo-he] is a small island i see from my home.
