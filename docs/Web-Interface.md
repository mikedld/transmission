A web interface is built into all Transmission flavors, enabling them to be controlled remotely.

## Enabling the web interface ##
Refer to the **Remote management** links in the [User Documentation](User-Documentation.md) for your client to find out how to enable the web interface.

## Accessing the web interface ##
Once enabled, open a web browser and direct it to http://ip_address_of_machine_running_transmission:9091/
If the web browser and the Transmission daemon are on the machine you can use http\://127.0.0.1:9091/
9091 is the default remote control port specified in [Transmission configuration](Editing-Configuration-Files.md).
