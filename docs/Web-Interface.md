A Web Interface is built into all Transmission flavours, enabling them to be controlled remotely.

## Enabling the Web Interface ##

Refer to the **Remote Management** links in the [[User Documentation|User-Documentation]] for your client to find out how to enable the Web Interface.

## Accessing the Web Interface ##
Once enabled, open a web browser and direct it to http://ip_address_of_machine_running_transmission:9091/
If web browser and Transmission Daemon are on the machine you can use http\://127.0.0.1:9091/
9091 is the default remote control port specified in [[Transmission configuration|Editing-Configuration-Files]].
