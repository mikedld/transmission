### Retro-compatibility

In Swift, whenever you need to use `if #available` syntax, you should encapsulate it with `#if compiler` with the min Swift version that supports it. Example:
```
#if compiler(>=5.3.1)
    if #available(macOS 11.0, *) {
        return NSImage(systemSymbolName: symbolName, accessibilityDescription: nil)
    }
#endif
```     

In ObjC, whenever you need to use `if (@available)` syntax, you should encapsulate it with `#ifdef __MAC_` with the min macOS version that supports it. Example:
```
#ifdef __MAC_11_0
    if (@available(macOS 11.0, *))
    {
        return [NSImage imageWithSystemSymbolName:symbolName accessibilityDescription:nil];
    }
#endif
```

### Code Style

`brew install swiftlint`
