     - Fastest: simply removing the object and re-adding it
     - Then: `self[i] = self[i - 1]` in a while loop [current implementation]
     - Then: `self[i] = self[i - 1]` in a `stride(from: fromIndex, to: toIndex, by: -1)` loop
     - Then: `swapAt(i, i - 1)` in a while loop
     - Slowest: SwiftUI's move(fromOffsets:toOffset:)
     On smaller distances, the performances differences are negligible, except for SwiftUI's API which is always slow.
